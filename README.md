## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am open to collaborations!

I am an AI Researcher at Amazon AWS AI Labs. My recent research focuses on LLMs, and I have a strong background in Graphs and Knowledge Learning. I like working with different people on different projects. Please drop me an email if you want to collaborate :)
